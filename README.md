## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a fourth-year student at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences with a strong interest in computer science and programming. Over the past three years, through active involvement and leadership in a student IT organization and Student Startups, I have developed valuable skills in teamwork, leadership, and adaptability. These experiences have allowed me to work in dynamic environments, manage teams, and drive projects forward.

I am ambitious, eager to learn, and always open to new challenges that will help me grow both technically and professionally. ðŸš€
